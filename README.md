## Installing Homebrew-scriptcs Formulae

[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) is a dependency of scriptcs so you either need to have Mono >= 3.0.0 already installed or you should accept the recommended installation of mono when installing scriptcs.

Just `brew tap c0ntinuum/homebrew-scriptcs` and then `brew install scriptcs`.

You can also install directly via a URL as follows:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/c0ntinuum/homebrew-scriptcs/master/scriptcs.rb
```
